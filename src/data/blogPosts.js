# GMAT Quantitative Reasoning: Data Sufficiency Mastery

Data Sufficiency questions are unique to the GMAT and often the most challenging part of the Quantitative section. This guide will help you master the systematic approach needed to excel.

## Understanding Data Sufficiency

Data Sufficiency questions test your ability to:
- Analyze mathematical problems
- Determine what information is needed
- Recognize when you have enough information

Each question has two statements, and you must determine if:
- Statement 1 alone is sufficient
- Statement 2 alone is sufficient  
- Both statements together are sufficient
- Each statement alone is sufficient
- Neither statement is sufficient

## The Systematic Approach

### Step 1: Understand the Question
- Read the question stem carefully
- Identify what you need to find
- Note any constraints or conditions

### Step 2: Analyze Statement 1
- Can you answer the question with just this information?
- Don't calculate unless necessary
- Eliminate answer choices based on your findings

### Step 3: Analyze Statement 2
- Forget about Statement 1 temporarily
- Can you answer the question with just Statement 2?
- Further eliminate answer choices

### Step 4: Consider Both Statements Together
- Only if neither statement alone is sufficient
- Do they provide enough information together?

## Common Traps to Avoid

1. **Calculating actual values** when you only need to determine sufficiency
2. **Combining statements too early** before checking each individually
3. **Making assumptions** not stated in the problem
4. **Forgetting about negative numbers** or zero

## Practice Strategy

### Phase 1: Learn the Format
- Understand the five answer choices
- Practice the systematic approach
- Focus on accuracy over speed

### Phase 2: Build Speed
- Time yourself on practice sets
- Recognize patterns in question types
- Develop shortcuts for common scenarios

### Phase 3: Advanced Techniques
- Handle complex algebraic manipulations
- Work with challenging geometry problems
- Master probability and statistics questions

## Key Tips for Success

1. **Don't solve unless you have to** - often you can determine sufficiency without calculating
2. **Use the answer choices strategically** - eliminate impossible options early
3. **Practice regularly** - Data Sufficiency requires specific skills that improve with practice
4. **Stay organized** - keep track of what each statement tells you

With consistent practice and the right approach, Data Sufficiency can become one of your strongest areas on the GMAT!

# LSAT Logical Reasoning: Assumption Questions Decoded

Assumption questions are among the most challenging in LSAT Logical Reasoning. This guide will help you understand how to identify, analyze, and answer these questions effectively.

## What Are Assumption Questions?

Assumption questions ask you to identify unstated premises that are necessary for an argument to be valid. They typically use phrases like:
- "The argument depends on which assumption?"
- "Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies?"
- "The argument presupposes which of the following?"

## Types of Assumptions

### 1. Necessary Assumptions
- Required for the argument to be valid
- If the assumption is false, the argument fails
- Use the negation test to verify

### 2. Sufficient Assumptions
- Make the argument valid if true
- Often stronger than necessary
- Less common in assumption questions

## The Negation Test

To verify a necessary assumption:
1. Negate the answer choice
2. If negating it destroys the argument, it's correct
3. If the argument still works, it's not necessary

**Example:**
- Argument: "John will pass the bar exam because he studied hard."
- Possible assumption: "Hard study leads to passing the bar exam."
- Negation: "Hard study does NOT lead to passing the bar exam."
- Result: This negation destroys the argument, so it's a necessary assumption.

## Common Assumption Patterns

### 1. Causal Assumptions
- Author assumes A causes B
- Must rule out alternative causes
- Must establish the causal relationship

### 2. Representativeness Assumptions
- Sample represents the whole population
- Survey results apply broadly
- Study participants are typical

### 3. Comparison Assumptions
- Two things are actually comparable
- Relevant similarities exist
- Important differences don't exist

## Strategy for Assumption Questions

### Step 1: Identify the Conclusion
- What is the author trying to prove?
- Look for conclusion indicators

### Step 2: Find the Evidence
- What support does the author provide?
- Identify the premises

### Step 3: Spot the Gap
- What's missing between evidence and conclusion?
- What must be true for the logic to work?

### Step 4: Predict the Assumption
- Think about what the author takes for granted
- Consider what would destroy the argument if false

### Step 5: Evaluate Answer Choices
- Use the negation test
- Eliminate choices that are too strong or irrelevant

## Practice Tips

1. **Focus on the argument structure** - understand how premises lead to conclusions
2. **Look for logical gaps** - these often point to assumptions
3. **Practice the negation test** - it's your most reliable tool
4. **Time yourself** - aim for 1.5 minutes per question

## Common Mistakes

- Choosing answers that strengthen rather than assume
- Picking overly broad or strong assumptions
- Focusing on irrelevant details
- Not using the negation test consistently

Master these techniques, and assumption questions will become much more manageable!

# SAT Reading: How to Tackle Evidence-Based Questions

Evidence-based questions are a unique feature of the SAT Reading section. These paired questions test your ability to identify textual support for your answers. This guide will help you master this challenging question type.

## Understanding Evidence-Based Questions

Evidence-based questions come in pairs:
1. **Primary Question**: Asks about the passage content
2. **Evidence Question**: Asks which lines best support your answer to the primary question

## The Systematic Approach

### Step 1: Read the Primary Question First
- Understand what you're looking for
- Note key words and concepts
- Don't look at answer choices yet

### Step 2: Locate Relevant Text
- Scan the passage for information related to the question
- Look for synonyms and paraphrases
- Mark potential evidence as you read

### Step 3: Answer the Primary Question
- Based on your understanding of the passage
- Choose the best answer from the options
- Keep your evidence in mind

### Step 4: Verify with Evidence Question
- Look at the evidence options
- Find the one that best supports your primary answer
- If no evidence supports your answer, reconsider the primary question

## Types of Evidence-Based Questions

### 1. Main Idea/Central Claim
- Look for thesis statements
- Check introduction and conclusion paragraphs
- Evidence often appears early or late in passage

### 2. Author's Attitude/Tone
- Look for evaluative language
- Check for positive/negative descriptors
- Evidence includes author's direct commentary

### 3. Character Analysis (Literature)
- Focus on character actions and dialogue
- Look for narrator's descriptions
- Evidence includes specific character moments

### 4. Cause and Effect
- Look for causal language (because, therefore, as a result)
- Check for temporal relationships
- Evidence shows clear connections

## Common Traps and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Choosing Evidence That's Too General
- Evidence should specifically support your answer
- Avoid broad statements that could support multiple answers

### 2. Selecting Evidence That's Too Specific
- Evidence should be substantial enough to support the claim
- Avoid minor details that don't prove the main point

### 3. Mismatching Primary and Evidence Answers
- Always check that your evidence actually supports your primary answer
- If they don't match, reconsider both

## Practice Strategy

### Phase 1: Accuracy Focus
- Work slowly through evidence-based pairs
- Check your reasoning for each answer
- Understand why wrong answers are incorrect

### Phase 2: Speed Development
- Time yourself on individual question pairs
- Aim for 2-3 minutes per pair
- Practice scanning quickly for evidence

### Phase 3: Integration
- Take full reading sections
- Maintain accuracy while building speed
- Review mistakes thoroughly

## Key Tips for Success

1. **Read actively** - engage with the text and take notes
2. **Use the evidence question as a check** - it can help you verify your primary answer
3. **Don't overthink** - the evidence is usually clear and direct
4. **Practice with various passage types** - literature, history, science, social studies

## Sample Question Analysis

**Primary Question**: "The author's attitude toward the new policy can best be described as..."

**Evidence Options**:
- Lines showing factual description (probably not the answer)
- Lines with evaluative language (likely correct)
- Lines about different topic (definitely wrong)
- Lines that are too general (probably wrong)

Look for the evidence that contains the author's direct opinion or evaluative language about the policy.

## Final Advice

Evidence-based questions reward careful, systematic thinking. Don't rush through these questions – take time to find solid textual support for your answers. With practice, you'll develop the skill to quickly identify relevant evidence and improve your overall Reading score.

  - Hypotenuse = 2x

### 45-45-90 Triangle
- Sides in ratio: 1 : 1 : √2
- If legs = x, then hypotenuse = x√2

### Common Pythagorean Triples
- 3-4-5 (and multiples: 6-8-10, 9-12-15, etc.)
- 5-12-13 (and multiples)
- 8-15-17 (and multiples)

## Coordinate Geometry

### Distance and Midpoint
- **Distance Formula**: d = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²]
- **Midpoint Formula**: M = ((x₁+x₂)/2, (y₁+y₂)/2)

### Lines
- **Slope**: m = (y₂-y₁)/(x₂-x₁)
- **Point-Slope Form**: y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)
- **Slope-Intercept Form**: y = mx + b

### Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
- **Parallel lines**: Same slope
- **Perpendicular lines**: Slopes are negative reciprocals (m₁ × m₂ = -1)

## Angles

### Basic Angle Relationships
- **Straight line**: 180°
- **Full rotation**: 360°
- **Vertical angles**: Equal
- **Complementary angles**: Sum to 90°
- **Supplementary angles**: Sum to 180°

### Polygon Angles
- **Sum of interior angles**: (n-2) × 180°
- **Each interior angle of regular polygon**: (n-2) × 180° / n
- **Sum of exterior angles**: Always 360°

## Study Strategy

### Phase 1: Memorization
- Create formula flashcards
- Practice writing formulas from memory
- Use spaced repetition

### Phase 2: Application
- Practice identifying which formula to use
- Work through example problems
- Time yourself on formula-based questions

### Phase 3: Integration
- Combine formulas in complex problems
- Practice with GRE-style questions
- Take timed practice sections

## Memory Tips

### 1. Group Related Formulas
- Study area formulas together
- Learn perimeter formulas as a group
- Practice 3D formulas separately

### 2. Use Visual Aids
- Draw shapes while memorizing
- Create diagrams for complex formulas
- Use color coding for different types

### 3. Practice Regularly
- Review formulas daily
- Use them in practice problems
- Test yourself without looking

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Confusing similar formulas** - Practice distinguishing between area and perimeter
2. **Forgetting to square the radius** - Remember πr², not πr
3. **Mixing up 3D formulas** - Volume vs. surface area
4. **Calculation errors** - Double-check arithmetic

## Quick Reference Card

Create a mental reference card with these must-know formulas:
- Triangle area: ½bh
- Circle area: πr²
- Rectangle area: lw
- Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²
- Distance formula: √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²]

## Final Advice

Don't just memorize these formulas – understand when and how to use them. The GRE tests your ability to apply geometric concepts, not just recall formulas. Practice with real GRE questions to build both speed and accuracy.

Remember: You won't have a formula sheet on test day, so these formulas must be committed to memory. Regular practice and review will make them second nature!
